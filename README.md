Thirsty? Have a drink [here](https://www.vin.trad-aidoud.fr/). I made this little website in order to discover Next.js. I created this website which aggregate lots of wines.

ShakeIt is a project ( made by 4 colleagues of WildcodeSchool and I ) where a user can search some cocktails ( React - MongoDB - API (cocktailDB) ). [Click here to have a drink](https://shakeit.netlify.app/)
